            <p>
                I am a passionate software engineering student at AltSchool Africa. I've had a deep curiosity about how digital products are built.
                Over time, I have developed a keen interest in Cloud Engineering, which has led me to join the AltSchool program.

            <h2>Why I Joined AltSchool Africa</h2>
            <p>
                I started out as a classroom teacher and morphed into the food processing industry. With the experiences I've had, I believe tech infrastructure is something we can't do without.
                I joined AltSchool to gain structured learning, mentorship, and access to a community of like-minded individuals.
                The program provides real-world skills and practical experience, which is essential for launching my career in cloud engineering.
